# NVC Framework - NonViolent Communication
## Step 1 - Observation 
* What I observe (See, hear, remember, imagine...). E.g.: *"When I (see, hear)..."*
* Our aim is to *describe* what we are reacting to concretely, specifically and neutrally, much as a video camera might capture the moment. 
* This **helps create a shared reality with the other person.** 
* The observation **gives the context for our expression of feelings and needs**, and may not even be needed of both people are clear about the context.
## Step 2 - Feelings
* How I feel (emotion or sensation). E.g.: *"I Feel..."*
* Our aim is to **identify, name and connect with those feelings.**
* The key to identifying and expressing feelings is to focus on words that describe our inner experience.
## Step 3 - Needs
* What I need or Value. E.g.: *"... because I need/value ..."*
* In the context of NVC, needs refer to what is most alive in us: **our core values and deepest human longings**. Understanding, naming, and connecting with our needs helps us improve our relationship with ourselves.
* The key to identifying, expressing, and connecting with needs is to focus on words that describe shared human experience
## Step 4 - Requests
* **Clearly requesting that which would enrich my life without demanding.**
* E.g.: *"Would you be willing to ... ?"*
* Our aim is to identify and express a specific action that we believe will serve this purpose, and then check with others involved about their willingness to participate in meeting our needs in this way.
* To increase the likelihood that our requests would be understood, we attempt to use language that is as concrete and doable as possible, and that is truly a request rather than a demand. For example, “I would like you to always come on time” is unlikely to be doable,
