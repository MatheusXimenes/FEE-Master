# Agile Methodologies Principles

## Agile Life Cycle:
1) Plan
2) Design
3) Develop
4) Test
5) Deploy
6) Review


## 4 Pillars:
1. Individual over processes and tools (Team Collaboration over by doing by the book)
2. Working Software over Documentation (Develop a good software)
3. Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation (Customer First)
4. Responding to change over following a plan (Freedom and Flexibility to shift strategies without derailing an entire project)

## Other Insights:
* Welcome changes even late
* Break the silos (Collaborate more frequently)
* Build projects around motivated individual
* Effective communication is face-to-face
* Working software is the primary measure of progress
* Maintain a sustainable working pace (No burn outs)
....

> *** Usage in Workflows that is constantly changing, no waterfall model here.




# Methodologies:

## 1. Kanban: 
* Card on Boards by stages
* Very Visual
* Backlog
* Can follow a RoadMap
E.g.:
Requested ==> Development ==> Code Review ==> Testing ==> Deployment ==> Done

## 2. Scrum:
* Small Team
* Sprints (2 Weeks cycles):
    - Planning (Sprint Kick off, What (Goals/Scope) & how & who, Effort Pointing - Fibonash)
        * Sprint Scope
        * Which tasks and who responsible for it 
        * Establish goals for the sprint, deadlines, and metrics to success
        * Roadblocks, issues, or scheduling conflicts for the current sprint
        * Items from Backlog
    - Retrospective: (Consistent Assessment)
        * Good
        * Points to improve 
        * Commitments and possible solutions
    - Daily - Stand Up Meetings (Share Updates, and Check-in with the rest of the team) 15min max
        * What has been accomplished so far?
        * What’s currently being worked on?
        * What’s up next?
        * Are there any obstacles or impediments or blockers preventing progress?
    - Review (Before Finishing Spring)
        * Individual Showcase - Acomplishment
        * Stakeholders Feedbacks

## 3. XP - Extreme Programming  (How will be done):
* communication
* Simplicity
* Feedback
* Courage
* Respect
