// What is Typescript:
* Is a Typed Programming Language based on Javascript
* Created by Microsoft
* Code Linting at the Code Editor (While Coding)
* Must be transpiler to Javascirpt using Babel


//Core Features:
* Enums:
- Enumerated Types - Data Structures (Set of constant Values)
E.g.: enum "name" { key = value }
enum Direction {
  North = "N",
  East = "E",
  South = "1"
  ...
}
JS Version: 
"use strict";
var CardinalDirection;
(function (CardinalDirection) {
    CardinalDirection["North"] = "N";
    CardinalDirection["East"] = "E";
    ...
})(CardinalDirection || (CardinalDirection = {}));


* Types vs Interfaces;
- Both are prety much the same, but with small extentions 
- Interfaces for Objects (Data) - Can Extents (Interface a 'extends' b)
- Types or Type alias for function or Classes - Must Combine (Type a ( '&' or '|' ) Type B)
  E.g.: type Hungry = boolean; or type Greeting = (name: string) => string;
- Classes cam 'implements' Interfaces


* Generics:
  - What is? Code Reusable for a variaty of Types 
  - Used For: Create Reusable. I call it "Something"
  - How to use it.
  E.g.:
  function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
    ...
  }

  
* Confitional
  func?.() // Undefined or Execute
  ?? 
  thing?.subThing?.property
  ! = Nonnull assertion
  as: type assertion
  is: type guard for function return types
  typeof and instanceof: type query used for refinement
  keyof: get keys of an object. keyof T is an operator to tell you what values of k can be used for obj[k].
  Some misconceptions here.
  O[K]: property lookup
  [K in O]: mapped types


* Overlaping Options

* React Definitions
* VueJs Definitions
* NodeJS Defnitions
